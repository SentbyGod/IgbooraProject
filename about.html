    <div class="about">
        <p>Followspots Concept is a multimedia company specialized in film production. 
        Our mission is to make the film industry accessible to young and aspiring actors, 
        and to prepare them for the rigors of the field. Our journey began 13 years ago in Abeokuta, Nigeria, 
        where we started as a drama troupe committed to acting out WAEC playtext. Since then, we've produced 
        three films and have gained invaluable experience in various film registers. <br><br>

        At Followspots Concept, we believe in educating and empowering young people with the tools they need to 
        succeed in the film industry. That's why we provide hands-on training in various film registers, including 
        documentary, drama, and comedy. We also offer life skills training and technical skills acquisition to ensure
        our trainees are well-rounded and prepared for the challenges ahead. <br><br>

        Our focus is on transforming the film industry in Nigeria by changing the narrative that it's only accessible 
        to the privileged or those who don't value education. Through our SIWES program, we're bridging the gap between 
        education and industry by providing practical training and mentorship to young people. <br><br>

        We're committed to making a difference in the film industry, and we're excited to continue our journey.
